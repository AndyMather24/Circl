# Circl

 ## Requirements:

 
- This must be built in a react native app with the default page being this one. You can choose to use Expo or not.
- When any fixture is clicked it should navigate to a screen but this can just be a blank screen (show usage of navigation)
- The tab bar can also navigate to a blank page
- The top bar should be collapsible and side scroll
- You can use mocked data for the fixtures which can be embedded in the app
 

Nice to haves:

- Serve mocked fixture data via nodeJS API
- Show usage of global storage (Redux or similar)
- Testing
